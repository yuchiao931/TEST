## Choosing a paper

1.  Inside the Box: Safety, Health, and Isolation in Prison [@western2021]
2.  Immigration and Crime: An International Perspective [@marie2024]

The first one was written by an author who used R to do most of the work, so the professor suggested that we choose another one.

This presentation is an reproducibility project of looking at two graphs from the paper Immigration and Crime: An International Perspective by the authors Olivier Marie and Paolo Pinotti [@marie2024].
