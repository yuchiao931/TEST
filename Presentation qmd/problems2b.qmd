## Problem and Solution

### Problem 1

![Figure 2. Problem 1](Fig/problem%201.png)

The gray "immigrant proportion" line is always close to 0. This is because the dual Y axes of ggplot2 are not truly "independently scaled", but share a set of numerical spaces

### Solution:

1.  Define a scaling parameter, say sf, to scale the murder rate to the range of 0–0.055: Use max(ts$hom_w) / max(ts$migr_w) to automatically calculate sf sf \<- max(ts$hom_w) / max(ts$migr_w)

2.  Multiply hom_w by sf in the graph to make it fall in the range of 0–0.055:

p1 \<- ggplot(ts, aes(x = year)) + geom_line(aes(y = migr_w), color = "grey40", linewidth = 1) + geom_point(aes(y = migr_w), color = "grey40", shape = 21) + geom_line(aes(y = hom_w / sf), color = "blue", linewidth = 1) + geom_point(aes(y = hom_w / sf),color = "blue", shape = 24) + scale_y_continuous( name = "Stock of migrants over population", \# Use \^ on the right axis to "reverse" the true murder rate sec.axis = sec_axis(\~ . \* sf, name = "Homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants") ) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1990, 2020, by = 5)) + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) print(p1) Here we use y = hom_w / sf when drawing the blue line (equivalent to "compressing" the murder rate to the small interval of the proportion of immigrants), Then use sec_axis(\~ . \* sf) to "expand" the label on the right back to the true murder rate value.

### Problem 2

No dots on scatter plot

![Figure 3. Problem 2](Fig/problem%202.png) The problem is in the plot data frame, all rows corresponding to x = dln_migr or y = dln_homic are treated as NA, so ggplot automatically discards them.

### Solution

Keep only the columns I need before pivoting

df_sc \<- df2 %\>% left_join(wb_pop, by = c("code","year")) %\>% select(code, year, ln_migr, ln_homic, pop_total) %\>% \# ← Throw away population, homicide_rate, and migr_pop pivot_wider( names_from = year, values_from = c(ln_migr, ln_homic, pop_total), names_sep = "\_" ) %\>% mutate( dln_migr = ln_migr_2019 - ln_migr_1990, dln_homic = ln_homic_2019 - ln_homic_1990 ) %\>% filter(!is.na(pop_total_1990))

### Problem 3

Unable to center image caption

![Original Graph](Fig/original.png){fig-cap="Figure 1. Original Graph" fig-align="center" width="60%" fig-attr="style=\"font-size:0.8em;\""}

### Solution

Make a styles.css file and typed figure \> figcaption {text-align: center;font-size: 0.8em;} and Reference it in YAML header
